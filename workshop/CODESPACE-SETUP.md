## Step 1: Wait for Automatic Setup ⏳

When you first open this Codespace, you'll see a notification "Setting up your codespace". This is normal! Your environment is being prepared with:
- 📱 Flutter SDK (about 2-3 minutes)
- 🔌 VS Code Extensions
- ⚙️ Project Dependencies

You'll know it's ready when you see "Setup complete" in the terminal.

## Step 2: Start the Workshop 🎵

Once you see "Setup complete":

1. Click the "Terminal" menu or press:
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + ` ` (backtick key)
   - Mac: `Cmd + ` ` (backtick key)

2. In the terminal, run these commands:
   ```bash
   # Change to the gitvision directory
   cd gitvision
   
   # Make the script executable (if needed)
   chmod +x workshop-start.sh
   
   # Run the setup script
   ./workshop-start.sh
   ```

## Step 3: Configure API Tokens 🔑

After the script runs:
1. Open `lib/config/api_tokens.dart`
2. Add your GitHub and Spotify tokens
3. Save the file

## Step 4: Follow Along 🎯

Open the [Workshop Guide](../WORKSHOP.md) and enjoy building!
